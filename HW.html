		<p> Lialina’s opinion about the user is that the term “user” and the “people” should have a clear division. She puts importance on the word user because as the word people is used instead of the user, there will be no difference in between the users and the developers and will lose the significance of the users. Likewise, developers and designers are mostly influenced and affected by the users; however as the user and the people does not have a clear devision line, it would not have effective interactions with each other.  </p>

		<p>An ideal internet user can be defined as Universal user and Turing complete user in Lialina’s perspective. She thinks that the users should be able to complete an applications or task without relying on a specific instructions. Even though the application serves different purposes, the users should be able to process what they desire beyond their abilities and to proceed successfully </p>

		<p> An example of gaps that needs to be filled by users are shown in different interfaces. One example is sending an email to a specific users. It is obvious to fill out the information that I desire to send, however, when it comes to fill out the informations about the person that I am sending to, it plays a role in filling the gaps by the users </p>
